# Hello, 
this is KPD1987 or in short KPD87 or just KP like some of my friends like to call me. ðŸ¥¹
I'm interested in learning new things about 3D-modeling, coding, Roleplaying games, and stuff like that. I've spend approximately 45-50hrs learning Autodesk Fusion 360 in the last few weeks and not more than few days using github. 
Next bigger thing I'd like to at least try is carving something on the wood (like owl or something like that)
My current hobbies are walking around like complete idiot, watching stuff on internet, playing on pc (favourite game is Baldur's Gate 3). Donald Duck is my favourite comic book character.
Favourite tv-show is The X-Files and movie is Godfather Trilogy. Still haven't watched the Coda cut.
I'm semi-active sports follower and my favourite teams are Liverpool FC and Oulun KÃ¤rpÃ¤t (ice hockey team from Finland)
I drink sh*itloads of coffee and other caffeine drinks. Also smoker who tries to quit that shit, again. My sense of humour is darker than coffee I drink and my coffee is really dark. Sarcastic piece of heck.

## Something More About me
Or not. Huh. You thought there was actually something?

### Even more something
Definitely not. Harhar. You read this anyway, because I said here would be something.


What? Why are you still here?
